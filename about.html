          key programming languages used to create websites. I also have basic

          editor in an IT firm for almost a year. I also have experience working
          with a team of IT professionals in the IT firm where I gained
          leadership, and time management skills, along with the capability of

          4 languages fluently, the languages include; Nepali, English, Hindi,
